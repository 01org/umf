# VMF desktop demo application

This application demonstrates key features of VMF 3.0: compression, encryption, statistics, etc.
The app should be run with the Android and iOS servers to display the data they stream.

To build desktop demo, do the following:

1. Download all submodules required for the demo: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. Open Vmf3DemoPlayer.pro in QtCreator, setup the project (use Qt with version 5.6 and higher) and run the build.
